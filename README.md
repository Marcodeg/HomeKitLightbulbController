# HomeKitLightbulbController

This framework aims to facilitate the use of bulbs through HomeKit.

__Why this framework?__

During the creation of an app for home automation through HomeKit, I found too complex the management of accessories and especially the bulbs.

__What can you do with this framework:__

- Color Animation *
- Intensity Animation
- Color Change
- Intensity Change
- Switching on/off
- Control of services **


_* A fluid animation that goes from one color to another recreating a gradient._

_**You can check if the light bulb is RGBUIColor or if it has other types of services such as intensity._
