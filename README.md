This framework aims to facilitate the use of bulbs through HomeKit.

__Why this framework?__

During the creation of an app for home automation through HomeKit, I found too complex the management of accessories and especially the bulbs.
So I decided to create this framework to facilitate the work of the team and have reusable code in the future.
Hoping that it will be useful to everyone. 

__What can you do with this framework:__

- Color Animation *
- Intensity Animation
- Brithness Animation
- Color Change
- Intensity Change
- Brightness Change
- Switching on/off
- Control of services **


_* A fluid animation that goes from one color to another recreating a gradient._

_**You can check if the light bulb is RGB or if it has other types of services such as intensity._
